# UX-Research-Lightning-Wallets
This repository serves as a living document during the UX Research process. It will constantly be updated and modified as the process is conducted as well as it evolves. 
# Summary
 My main focus will be integrating a UX Research approach to the development process of non-custodial bitcoin lightning network products in the bitcoin design guide.  The aim is to explore the current user experience of LN wallets and to take that information back into the product development process.
 
 **__We want to create products that users not only desire but want to use on a daily basis.__**
 
UX research to be a process that flexible to the product development process, easy to understand and even easier to intergrate.

# Motivation
As more and more Lightning wallets enter into the bitcoin space we want to get closer to users during the product development process so that:
* We create a positive experience for users when using a Lightning wallet, one in which they feel **trust**, **confidence** and **in control**.
* We create apps that are highly **desireable** leading to more adoption and daily use.
* We understand and remove any obstacles in the user experience that cause friction.
# Methodology

Conduct UX research from beginning to end on 2-3 Lightning projects, this will be an iterative process which will constantly be re-evaluated based on the needs of the open-source ecosystem.
During the research process I will aim to understand:

* **Use cases**<br/> What are some of the main use cases of people who are using a wallet on a daily basis? <br/><br/>
How?<br/> 
Speak to LN wallet users in the form of conducting an open dialogue.

* **Benchmarking**<br/> Best practices used by LN wallet builders with the aim of learning from those best practices.<br/><br/>
How? <br/>
Perform competitive benchmarking on 2-3 Lighting wallets and performing a heurstic analysis on various aspects of the interface design.

* **User Flows** <br/> What is the shortest most friendly journey for the user?<br/><br/>
How?<br/>
Compare the userflows of various Lightning wallets by analyzing them and focusing on screen states as well as menu/settings configurations. 

* **User behaviour** <br/> How do users interact with the interface?<br/><br/>
How?<br/>
Conduct Usability tests remotely or in person with users and gather data based on thier behaviour and questions.

These various forms of data will then be analyzed and reccomendations will be then provided.
