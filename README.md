# UX-Research-Lightning-Wallets
This repository serves as a living document during the UX Research process. It will constantly be updated and modified as the process is conducted as well as it evolves. 
# Summary
 My main focus will be integrating a UX Research approach to the development process of non-custodial bitcoin lightning network products in the bitcoin design guide.  The aim is to explore the current user experience of LN wallets and to take that information back into the product development process.
 
 > **__We want to create products that users not only desire but want to use on a daily basis.__**
 
My goal is to present UX Research as a process that is flexible to the product development process, easy to understand and even easier to intergrate.

# Timeline
15 June 2022 - 15 June 2023
# Motivation
As more and more Lightning wallets enter into the bitcoin space we want to get closer to users during the product development process so that:
* We create a positive experience for users when using a Lightning wallet, one in which they feel **trust**, **confidence** and **in control**.
* We create apps that are highly **desireable** leading to more adoption and daily use.
* We understand and remove any obstacles in the user experience that cause friction.
# Methodology

Conduct UX research from beginning to end on 2-3 Lightning projects, this will be an iterative process which will constantly be re-evaluated based on the needs of the open-source ecosystem.
During the research process I will aim to understand:

* **User interviews**<br/><br/>
How?<br/> 
We want to understand what are some of the main use cases of people who are using a wallet on a daily basis? To understand users and how they use LN wallets I will conduct an indpeth interview with 5 wallet users to understand them and how the use of a wallet fits in and supports them in achieving thier goals on a daily basis.

* **Competitive Benchmarking**<br/><br/>
How? <br/>
The landscape of LN wallets is diverse and rich with many builders arriving to the arena who have teams of UX designers and developers constantly iterating during the product development process. We can learn alot from what is already being done. With this goal in mind I will perform competitive benchmarking on 2-3 Lighting wallets by using heurstic analysis on various aspects of the interface designs.

* **User Flows Analysis** <br/><br/>
How?<br/>
Getting users to thier end goal as efficiently and as smoothly as possible ensures that apps are used more frequently and with ease. To understand how various wallets are solving the same problem I will compare the userflows of various Lightning wallets by analyzing them and focusing on screen states as well as menu/settings configurations. 

* **Usability tests** <br/><br/>
How?<br/>
To understand how users acre interacting with the interface and where there is friction we must observe the users. To do this I will conduct usability tests remotely or in person with users and gather data based on thier behaviour and questions.

* **Accessibility Analysis** <br/><br/>
How?<br/>
To understand how friendly wallet interfaces are to people with disabilities I will analyze screenstates with accessibility practices in mind.

These various forms of data will then be analyzed and reccomendations will be then provided.
